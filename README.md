Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
We are trying to create dataframes to summarize ride sharing data.  We use the pandas functions to create a graph about average fare, driver 
and riders in Rural, Suburban and Urban areas.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Rural area although has less total riders, it has a higher average fare per rider and driver.  Urban area has more total
riders and average fare per ride and driver are higher.  Suburban area falls somewhere in the middle with total rider
and driver being more rural and less than urban.  

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1.  I would increase the average fare per driver in Urban areas so the driver are earning more.

2.  Drivers should work in maximize fare prices by the type of areas they are working in.

3.  I would change the fare amount depend on driver count in different areas.
